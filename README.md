# DiscordBot-StatusChanger

### Goals:
- Change status to "In class: className" during my scheduled class
- Change back to original status when class ends
- Set myself to busy during class so I don't get notifications in class, change back afterwards
- Send me a reminder 20 minutes before class starts
- Add the option to turn it off for the day (like for a holiday or snowday in the middle of the week)
- Automatically nickname the bot itself

## Current Commands:

- `ping` - Pings the bot, who responds with "pong!"
- `shutdown` - properly closes the bot's program
